# SQL Project Overview

To answer the questions posed by the different departments, I was tasked with querying the data using SQL. 
I wrote moderately complex SQL queries to answer various business questions presented by stakeholders.
I then presented the SQL resutls by creating visualizations to tel a compelling story about the data.
My findings were summed up in a professional presentation that was reviewed and approved.
